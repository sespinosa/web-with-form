# Frequently Asked Questions

## I read the [README.md](README.md) file and i still don't understand.

Well, 2 things:
 - You can google all this shit, is not rocket science.
 - You can create tickets (issues) on this github repository, ill try to check them with some regularity and respond to your beautiful questions.

## You are all over the place, how I'm supposed to understand this?

Well, that's why i expect people's feedback and pull requests, i'm happy to approve changes from others if the changes make sense, I hope this gets better with the time, the explanation on how to submit changes is on this document, on the `How I can submit changes to improve this repository?` question.

## Why in the hell you did all this work?

Ok, let's be really honest for a moment, i needed to do something for my real work (because even if it sounds imposible, i get paid to do this kind of things, EVERY MONTH!, it's crazy), so i started doing a really quick and dirty thing, but because is quick and really dirty, it took me more time to fix stuff that was failing instead of doing it good from the begining.

So i started this project, then i thought, "Maybe i can do something i can reuse", and the weekend came, so i have some spare time to put on this, but then i realized other thing, ***This can be really helpful for people that are having a hard time starting on the web development world***.

So i did it, one pass, and then if some issues are raised, and can fix things and make it better with the help of the beautiful internet people.

## Why do you write so confusing documentation?

I am VERY bad a this (ADHD here) so i think this is a good way to practice, all the critical feedback is highly appreciated so if you think something can be better, or i just overcomplicated some stuff, please tell me, create a ticket (issue on github) or just change the thing, ill explain this process on the next question.

## Why your english sucks ass?

I'm not native, english is my second language and I'm improving it everyday, I'm from Chile and here we speak "Spanish" (emphasis on the double quotes).

## So if you are from a spanish talking country, why do you write documentation in english?

I'm hoping thi can be useful for the biggest ammount of people posible.

## The documentation will be available in Spanish at some moment?

Ojala que si po wn.

## How I can submit changes to improve this repository?

- Fork this project on your own github repository, with the `fork` button (you need your own github account).

- Clone the fork into your computer (a fork is like a copy, but git still knows the parent of that copy).

- Make the changes you want to do.

- `git add <file modified>`

- `git commit -m "<A little description of what you did>"`

- `git push`

This will add the changes to your fork, after that you need to submit a `pull request` from your repository (your fork) to the base repository (the one you forked).

A `pull request` is basically a way to ask the owner of a repo to merge code from other person into the codebase, can be code on another branch (that is inside the same repo) or from a external repository (owned by someone else).

To create this specific pull request you need to go to the base repository (the one that was forked), and press the `new pull request` button, in the menu that will be shown, you need to select the base repo (the original one), and the one you want to add to it (the one you own that you want to merge with the original one), be super careful in this part, `the arrow ` will help to understand the "direction" on how things are supposed to be.
